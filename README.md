# Ensemble Learning with Credit Card Application

In this project, the **Credit Card Application Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used to predict whether a given customer should be approved for a credit application. The goal is to apply different **ensemble learning techniques** to improve the accuracy of predictions compared to single machine learning models.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains data related to credit card applications, including information about customers and their credit approval status. It is a binary classification problem where the target variable indicates whether a customer's credit application is approved or not.

### Techniques Applied
This project explores and implements **six ensemble learning techniques**, each of which is designed to improve the model's performance by combining the predictions of multiple base learners:

1. **Averaging**: Combining the predictions of multiple models by averaging their outputs.
2. **Weighted Averaging**: Similar to Averaging, but assigning different weights to the predictions of each model.
3. **Max Voting**: The final prediction is based on the majority vote of the individual classifiers.
4. **Bagging**: A technique that trains multiple models on different subsets of the data and combines their predictions.
5. **Boosting**: A method that combines weak learners sequentially, where each new model attempts to correct the errors made by the previous one.
6. **Stacking**: Involves training multiple models and using another model to combine their predictions effectively.

### Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to assess how ensemble learning techniques can improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions when determining whether a customer should be approved for a credit card.

### Methodology
- The models were trained and evaluated using a set of ensemble learning techniques.
- The **Packt course** was used as a reference to define and implement the necessary concepts for each ensemble technique.

### Libraries and Tools Used

- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing various machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data handling.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and performance evaluation.
